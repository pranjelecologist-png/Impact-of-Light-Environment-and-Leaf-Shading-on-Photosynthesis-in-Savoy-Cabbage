# Impact-of-Light-Environment-and-Leaf-Shading-on-Photosynthesis-in-Savoy-Cabbage
This repository presents a plant ecophysiology study investigating how light environment and short term leaf shading influence photosynthetic performance in Savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea). The project compares plants grown outdoors under natural sunlight with plants grown in a greenhouse under filtered light, combined with a bagging treatment to reduce direct light exposure at the leaf level.

Photosynthetic responses were assessed using PAM chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange measurements, focusing on PSII efficiency, light use efficiency, photosynthetic rate, and transpiration. The results show that leaves exposed to intense outdoor light exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency, indicating photoinhibition. In contrast, shaded leaves and greenhouse grown plants showed higher PSII performance and more stable photochemical responses.

Greenhouse conditions consistently supported higher photosynthetic and transpiration rates, suggesting that moderate, filtered light promotes efficient gas exchange and carbon assimilation. Outdoor plants displayed signs of increased light stress but also showed improved PSII recovery when shaded, pointing to protective physiological responses under high UV exposure.

Overall, the findings highlight how both growth environment and short term shading shape photosynthetic performance and demonstrate how plants balance light capture with stress avoidance under changing light conditions.
